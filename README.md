# termTicker
-Made an app that displays how many time a term has appeared on a webpage and saves it.
-Used a JavaScript method for parsing all data from Web and displaying in background thread
-Used NSRegular Expressions to count and parse text to extract how many times a term appears accounting for variations of cases - 
Use core data for object lifecycle for count of user defined term and stores result for future reference.

We are still working on adding a clock that allows the app to dynamically update the number of times the word appears on url and 
eventually to see the ananlysis and frequency of the terms that have appeared on the url.
